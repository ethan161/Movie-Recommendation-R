# Overview

I wrote this software as an introduction to the R language. It also allows the user to choose a movie to watch based on criteria they will feed into the computer, as well as view some statistics about the movies contained in the program.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code was used to write this program, and RGui was used to initialize this procedure.

Because R is a data-process based language, I thought it especially fitting to write a program like this. The dplyr library was used for a filter function.

# Future Work

- I want to add a way to change, add, and save the movie list between uses. It is especially small right now, and that could speed up the addition process. This would require a csv file.
- Another thing I should have changed was my print statements. At the moment, all the text is surrounded by quotation marks and ruins some of the legibility of the program.
- Because of the small sample size, the program is not very useful right now. Finding a file set of movies that I could integrate into my program could make a lot of the statistics much more useful.
